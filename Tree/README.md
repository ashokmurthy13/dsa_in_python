## Some Tree Types
* Binary Trees
* Binary Search Trees
* AVL Trees
* Red-Black Trees
* 2-3 Trees

### Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has between 0-2 children. They’re called the left and right children of the node. 

### Balanced Tree

A binary tree is height-balanced if, for each node in the tree, the difference between the height of the right subtree and the left subtree is at most one.

    ∣Height(LeftSubTree)−Height(RightSubTree)∣<=1
